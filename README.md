# light-std-graphics

This library is an extention to [lstd](https://github.com/Repertoi-e/light-std) (a C++20 library created for personal use that aims to replace the standard C/C++ library).

It provides a high-level windowing API (like GLFW) and high-level graphics API. The low level graphics API we currently use is DirectX.
