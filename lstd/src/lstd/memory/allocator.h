// _mode_ is what we are doing currently: allocating, resizing, freeing a block or freeing everything
//      (*implementing FREE_ALL is NOT a requirement, depends on the use case of the user code)
// _context_ is used as a pointer to any data the allocator needs (state)
// _size_ is the size of the allocation
// _oldMemory_ is used when resizing or freeing a block
// _oldSize_ is the old size of memory block, used only when resizing
//
// the last pointer to u64 is reserved for options. It is a pointer to allow the allocator function
// to modify it and propagate it to the library implementation of allocate/reallocate/free.
//
// One example use is for our debug check for leaks when the library terminates.
// The temporary allocator doesn't allow freeing so there is no reason for the library to report unfreed blocks from it.
// So the temporary allocator modifies the options to include LEAK (that flag is defined just above this comment).
//
//
// !!! When called with FREE_ALL, a return value of null means success!
//     To signify that the allocator doesn't support FREE_ALL (or the operation failed) return: (void*) -1.
//
// !!! When called with RESIZE, this doesn't mean "reallocate"!
//     Only valid return here is _oldMemory_ (memory was grown/shrank in place)
//     or null - memory can't be resized and needs to be moved.
//     In the second case we allocate a new block and copy the old data there (in general_reallocate).
//
// !!! Alignment is handled internally. Allocator implementations needn't pay attention to it.
//     When an aligned allocation is being made, we send a request at least _alignment_ bytes larger,
//     so when the allocator function returns an unaligned pointer we can freely bump it.
//     The information about the alignment is saved in the header, that's how we know what
//     the old pointer was when freeing or reallocating.
//
// We do this so custom allocator implementations don't require boiler plate code.
// For examples see how we implement default allocator, temporary allocator, linked list allocator, etc.

//
// The values of the constants and the following comment is taken from MSVC:
//
// The following values are non-zero, constant, odd, large, and atypical.
// - Non-zero values help find bugs that assume zero-filled data
// - Constant values are good so that memory filling is deterministic (to help
//   make bugs reproducible). Of course, it is bad if the constant filling of
//   weird values masks a bug.
// - Mathematically odd numbers are good for finding bugs assuming a cleared
//   lower bit (e.g. properly aligned pointers to types other than char are not odd).
// - Large byte values are less typical and are useful for finding bad addresses.
// - Atypical values are good because they typically cause early detection in code.
// - For the case of the no-man's land and free blocks, if you store to any of
//   these locations, the memory integrity checker will detect it.
